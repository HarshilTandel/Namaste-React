## Q: What is `Emmet`?
A: Emmet is a plug in for many popular text editors which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow.

## Q: Difference between a `Library and Framework`?
A:Both the framework vs library is precoded support programs to develop complex software applications. However, libraries target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.

## Q: What is `CDN`? Why do we use it?
A: A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.


## Q: Why is `React known as React`?
A: React is aptly named because: It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage. It's built around components that "react" and update.

## Q: What is `crossorigin in script tag`?
A: It is used to handle the CORS request that checks whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domains.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials">
```

## Q: What is difference between `React and ReactDOM`?
A: `React` is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces whereas `ReactDOM` is also JavaScript library that allows `React to interact with the DOM`.
The react package contains `React.createElement()`, `React.Component`, `React.Children`, and other helpers related to elements and component classes. You can think of these as the isomorphic or universal helpers that you need to build components. The react-dom package contains `ReactDOM.render()`, and in react-dom/server we have server-side rendering support with `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` and `ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup()`.


## Q: What is difference between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` files via `CDN`?
A: `Development` is the stage of an application before it's made public while `production` is the term used for the same application when it's made `public`.
`Development build` is several times (maybe 3-5x) `slower` than the `production build`.


## Q: What is `async and defer`?
A: `Async` - The async attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed as soon` as it is available (do not block HTML DOM construction during downloading process) and donâ€™t wait for anything.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script src="demo_async.js" async></script>
```

`Defer` - The defer attribute is a `boolean attribute`. The script is downloaded in `parallel(in the background)` to parsing the page, and `executed after the page` has finished parsing(when browser finished DOM construction). The `defer attribute` tells the browser `not to wait for the script`. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM.
### _Syntax_
```sh
<script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
```

Unless you're supporting ancient legacy systems, always add `type="module"` to all your script tags:
```sh
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script> and place the tag inside <head>
```
```sh
 <script defer nomodule> can be used as a legacy fallback.
```

As the name suggests, it allows you to import `modules`, which makes it easier to organize your code.
Enable `strict mode` by default. This makes your code run faster, and reports more runtime errors instead of silently ignoring them.
Execute your code only after the DOM has `initialized`, which makes DOM manipulation easier. Thanks to this, you won't need to listen to load/readystatechange/DOMContentLoaded events.
Prevent top level variables from implicitly polluting the global namespace.
Allow you to use top-level await in supported engines.
Load and parse your code `asynchronously`, which improves load performance.
